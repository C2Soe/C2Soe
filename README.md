- 👋 Hi, I’m @C2Soe
- 👀 I’m a senior studying at a liberal arts college in Ohio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and working on my knowledge in R and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to sharing the projects that I have worked on in and out of the class. I am also hoping to work in the industry as a data analyst after I graduate.
- 📫 Reach out to me at ksoe23@wooster.edu with any questions about my projects or if you are looking for a friend sharing similar interest as you.
